# chessbot
discord bot for chess

# Libaries
- [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
- [python-chess](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess)
- cairo2svg for picture rendering
- and all of their dependencies

This requires Python 3.5+.

# What it does currently
- allow for two players in a discord chat to play chess
- each move will display an image updated with your current move
- the bot will tell you if you make illegal moves/out of turn moves 
- adheres to strict syntax i.e. (nc5 must be Nc5)

# What it should do in the future
- a !help command listing out valid commands
- a way to store games for persisent storage/multiple games at once in a discord room
- a way to keep track of win/loss against a certain user
- a clean way to offer a draw
- a command to show the notation of a match
- get hosted on a cheap server that isn't my own computer

# Example
    - (will write later)
